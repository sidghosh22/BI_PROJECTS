Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze key performance indicators in the hospitality industry, providing a comprehensive view of booking, revenue, and cancellation trends. 


Overview
The left panel summarizes KPIs, showing total bookings (119.4K), revenue ($29.6M), cancellation rate (37%), and financial losses due to cancellations. 

·      Monthly Booking Trends
A time series line chart tracks monthly booking patterns, with projections highlighting potential scenarios for the next six months.
·      Revenue & Loss Analysis
Visualizes monthly revenue alongside revenue lost to cancellations, revealing that both often peak together during high-demand seasons.
·      Cancellation Impact
Two pie charts show that bookings with longer lead times (>30 days) have an elevated cancellation risk, causing 81.96% of revenue loss.
·      Cancellation & Room Rates
A table compares cancellation rates and room rates across lead times and locations, indicating that shorter lead times and resort locations have lower cancellation rates.
·      Seasonal Revenue Fluctuations 
Combined charts show that summer months experience high cancellations and fluctuating room rates, impacting revenue.
·      Channel Performance 
Highlights that online travel agents, despite high cancellations, drive the highest revenue, whereas corporate bookings show lower cancellations.

Recommendations
Advises reconsidering bookings with long lead times, boosting marketing during peak periods, and implementing strategies to reduce cancellations.

Future Scope
Real-time data integration, predictive analytics, customer segmentation, and sentiment analysis on customer feedback would further enhance insights and decision-making capabilities.
